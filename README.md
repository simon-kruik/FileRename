# FileRename
This project was intended for renaming files in Windows for Plex servers. 
For adding season numbers (e.g. S05E__) in bulk to multiple files in a folder. 
It has a hardcoded regex which finds 2 or 3 digit numbers with a leading space, and appends whatever string you wish before that. 
It requires Python 3 [https://www.python.org/downloads/].
